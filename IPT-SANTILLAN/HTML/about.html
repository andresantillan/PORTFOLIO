                    <p>
                        Hello! I'm John Andre Santillan, a passionate computer programming student with a deep interest in creating websites and exploring the world of game development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’ve had the opportunity to work on a variety of websites across different subjects, gaining hands-on experience with web technologies. While I'm still learning and improving my skills, I am dedicated to mastering web development and producing better, more efficient websites with each project I take on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I'm focused on deepening my understanding of programming concepts, frameworks, and design principles to build more dynamic and functional websites. However, my ultimate dream is to become a game developer. I aspire to develop immersive games that inspire others, just as I have been inspired by the games I’ve played.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm excited about the journey ahead, and I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and feel free to check out some of the projects I've worked on!
                    </p>
